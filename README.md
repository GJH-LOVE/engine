basic opengl demo

Hi I am a postgraduate from Wuhan University of Technology in China. This project is a created for my postgraduate essays. This project's ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly C++ OpenGL rendering api like three.js(looks far away now). What I really hope is that people who loves graphics programming or c++ programming can learn and share ideas, skills, and programming trikcs in this place. However I'm totally a green hand in programming, so I really appreciate someone experienced and knowledgeable can make adivse for me, share ideas with me.

What I really hope now is there anyone can help me to correct this readme file, because my english is astonish poor!
